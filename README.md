Install dependencies:
npm ci

Run the development server:
npm run dev

OR

Skip last two steps and move to Docker Setup below
P.S. npm run dev without a docker containerization only ensure the codebase is not broken

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app (if you ran npm ci or npm run dev)
```
# Docker Setup
```
Build the Docker Image
docker build -t trading-sim-app .

Run the Container
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 trading-sim-app

Access the app at http://localhost:3000
```
# Continuous Integration (CI)

This project is set up with a GitHub Actions workflow to ensure code quality and build integrity on every push or pull request. The CI pipeline includes:
```
Installing dependencies
Running lint and type checks
Building the Next.js application
Running automated tests
```
The above ensures that the code is always verified before being deployed to production or containerized environments.
